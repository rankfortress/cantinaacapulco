	<h1>Acapulco Cantina </h1>
	<p>
	Inspired from a young age, Rosalie San Jose always wanted to emulate her mother, Rosario ('Nanay'), who would prepare, cook and sell her sumptuous produce to passers by in the street where they lived. Street food, very much one of today's UK growing eating trends was simply a way of life where Rosalie grew up, but it also a life that she and her family loved!The journey to follow in “Nanay’s” footsteps eventually took Rosalie via Manila, Brunei & Dubai - working in many restaurants and hotels, continually cultivating her culinary knowledge and skills - to...... Radcliffe!
	
	As Rosalie’s first street-food location, Radcliffe Market has proved to be an inspired choice, with a receptive and curious audience, supportive colleagues (traders) and a forward thinking centre-management team. Opening on 22nd March 2019, Rosalie's 'Acapaulco' Mexican street food business got off to a flying start, with many of the adjoining businesses sampling and enjoying the mouth watering, more-and-more-ish traditional Nachos, Burritos and Quesadillas... including quality Vegan options too!Not one to rest on her laurels, Rosalie is already looking to add to the menu in order to cater for her own street foodies in the heart of beautiful Lancs. It's a long way from home where Rosalie lovingly watched and learned from her mum, and Nanay would be proud!
